### Impetus
This website is the product of multiple needs:
- Practicing Front End Web Development.
- Wanting to make something real, not just a fictitious company page.
- Not finding anything like it on the web.

When searching for non-alcoholic drink recipes, I could find many lists of recipes, and there were food and drink sites that would often have some small category or occasional article dedicated to non-alocholic drinks. Of the information I did find, it was often scattered, too narrowly focused, or otherwise difficult to use. I have also found that many recipes are hosted on blogs, where the user has to scroll past a wall of text and advertisements just to see the recipe. Even worse, sometimes the recipes were so verbose and punctuated by pictures that they were frustrating to use (too much scrolling, scanning, and reading, just to make a drink). Additionally, many of the most intriguing drinks required ingredients unlikely to be in most users kitchens like non-alcoholic distilled spirits (SeedLip, etc).
In response, this website aims to:
1. Be all about non-alcoholic drinks
2. Contain a large, diverse library of recipes
3. Format recipes in a way that is very easy to use (no scrolling or scanning required)
4. Have some recipes with more complex flavor profiles while not always requiring expensive, uncommon ingredients.
